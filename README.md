# PanImageTest
This is a JavaFx test program to explore displaying images with Pan and Zoom in
a ScrollPanel. 

It doesn't work as yet. The panning behaviour does not allow panning
to the corners of the image when the image is zoomed more than 1x1. 

Also the image should center in the viewport when the image is smaller than
the viewport, and panning should be disabled.

A work in progress.
